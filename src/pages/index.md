      ### About


      Perched on the mountains of San Ramon, Alajuela, Balboa, Santiago. A proud
      family company of the Vargas Jimenez family of more than 40 years. We
      trade directly with this family. Working on the farm for 9 months +,
      harvesting and planting , gave me a great appreciation of the process. We
      visit annually and we are proud of producing traditional Costa Rican
      roasting processes to accentuate the flavors of the Valle Occidental
      region.


      Organic growing practices are used on this family owned and operated farm
      to ensure the best cup of coffee possible. Fair Trade cultivated and
      harvested, when you drink this cup of coffee, know that you are often less
      than 2 degrees of seperation away from the hands that grew the beans.


      Say hello to Enrique Vargas.

      ## This is my Costa Rican Family.


      My name is Greg, and I'm the guy sitting in the middle. As you can see,
      the place that my coffee comes from is more than just a farm. They are my
      friends and family and I am proud to offer you the best coffee I know of.


      Enjoy a perfectly balanced, clean cup, with strong stone fruit and toasted
      nut flavors. Presenting all of the classic flavor profiles of the Valle
      Occidential, look forward to a light but strong blend of aromas and
      flavors, without any of the muddy and bland flavors of your pre-ground
      store brand coffee. Treat yourself to The Best Costa Rican Coffee I know,
      and joining the family.
