      #### About


      Perched on the mountains of San Ramon, Alajuela, Balboa, Santiago.  A
      proud family company of the Vargas Jimenez family of more than 40 years.
      We trade directly with this family.  Working on the farm for 9 months +,
      harvesting and planting , gave me a great appreciation of the process.  We
      visit annually and we are proud of producing traditional Costa Rican
      roasting processes to accentuate the flavors of the Valle Occidental
      region.
