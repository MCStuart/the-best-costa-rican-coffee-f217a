      ### About



      Perched on the mountains of San Ramon, Alajuela, Balboa, Santiago. A proud
      family company of the Vargas Jimenez family of more than 40 years. We
      trade directly with this family. Working on the farm for 9 months +,
      harvesting and planting , gave me a great appreciation of the process. We
      visit annually and we are proud of producing traditional Costa Rican
      roasting processes to accentuate the flavors of the Valle Occidental
      region.


      Organic growing practices are used on this family owned and operated farm
      to ensure the best cup of coffee possible. Fair Trade cultivated and
      harvested, when you drink this cup of coffee, know that you are often less
      than 2 degrees of seperation away from the hands that grew the beans.


      Say hello to Enrique Vargas.
